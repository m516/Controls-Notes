# This Action autogenerates PDFs and standalone HTML out of your Overleaf projects (or any LaTeX-live project).
# It uses pdflatex to generate the PDF and make4ht to generate the HTML
# 
#    Given:
#       A repository with a LaTeX project with main.tex in the root folder
#   
#    On every push:
#       This GitHub Action builds the project with LaTeX Live. 
#       A   PDF version of main.tex is uploaded to a Release called "Current." 
#           (Make sure that release exists first)
#       An HTML version of main.tex is uploaded to a new branch called gh-pages. 
#           (Make sure GitHub Pages is active and reads from the gh-pages branch)
