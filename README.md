The study of many kinds of systems, control policies, matrices, and vector spaces (including functions) comprises control theory. This document is a free, community-driven growing dictionary of these terms, designed for quickly finding more information about them.

It is available in a few formats:
* [PDF](https://github.com/m516/Controls-Notes/releases/download/Current/main.pdf), 
* [HTML](https://m516.github.io/Controls-Notes/), and 
* [LaTeX](https://github.com/m516/Controls-Notes) source code.

## Contributions
Contributions are not just welcome, they are necessary to keep this project going strong. Generously donating 15 minutes of your time can describe a term that confuses someone else or refine an inaccurate/incorrect definition to make a lasting impact on control theory studies.
