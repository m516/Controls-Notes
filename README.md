A=B*C, where 
* A={this project}, 
* B={my desire to learn control theory}, and 
* C={my inability to remember names and symbols}

This document is an ongoing collection of symbols, theorems, 
tools, and terms I have found useful for studying control theory.

It is available in a few formats:
* [PDF](https://github.com/m516/Controls-Notes/releases/download/Current/main.pdf), 
* [HTML](https://m516.github.io/Controls-Notes/), and 
* [LaTeX](https://github.com/m516/Controls-Notes) source code.

It also serves as a template for sharing LaTeX projects that 
are automatically built and hosted by GitHub.
